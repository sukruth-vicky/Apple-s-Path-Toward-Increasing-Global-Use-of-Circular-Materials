Apple has been working to accelerate the global shift toward circular materials by improving transparency, strengthening supply chain visibility, and supporting mining communities that produce key minerals. 
Circular materials allow companies to reuse resources instead of relying on continuous mining. 
McKinsey & Company partnered with Apple to understand the challenges across the minerals value chain and identify ways to increase circularity worldwide.

The project focused on two key minerals critical to technology manufacturing. The team studied how these materials move from mining to processing, refining, and final use. 
Apple wanted to understand where circularity breaks down, what prevents recycling, and how to create pathways for more sustainable sourcing.

McKinsey helped Apple conduct extensive research into extraction methods, worker conditions, environmental impact, and the economic pressures affecting mining communities. 
The analysis showed that limited transparency, inconsistent data, poor recycling infrastructure, and the lack of economic incentives were major barriers to circular adoption. 
Apple and the team identified interventions to strengthen sustainable practices and support communities involved in extraction.

A major part of the work involved field research, interviews, and collaboration with local partners. Apple wanted to ensure that solutions improved both environmental and social outcomes. 
The goal was to create a clearer picture of how minerals flow through the system and build models that support long-term resilience.

The result was a comprehensive understanding of the global materials chain and practical actions to increase circular material use. 
The project highlighted opportunities for better data systems, stronger partnerships with suppliers, and long-term investment in communities that rely on mineral extraction. 
Apple’s work demonstrates how leading companies can influence global sustainability by improving supply chain practices and advancing circular economy principles.
