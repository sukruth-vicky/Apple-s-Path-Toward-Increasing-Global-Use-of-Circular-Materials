Circularity requires full visibility into how materials are mined, processed, and reused.

Many communities depend heavily on mineral extraction and require support during any sustainability transition.

Data gaps across the supply chain limit the ability to track materials and measure environmental impact.

Recycling infrastructure remains insufficient for high-demand minerals, slowing circular progress.

Companies like Apple can accelerate global circularity through long-term partnerships and investment in local ecosystems.

Successful circularity models must consider environmental, economic, and social realities simultaneously.
